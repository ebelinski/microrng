# MicroRNG Software Kit

[MicroRNG](https://tectrolabs.com/microrng/) is a hardware (true) random number generator device that can be used in embedded systems as a reliable entropy source. It can interface with microcontrollers or microprocessors (mainboards) with integrated circuits and modules through a mikroBUSâ„¢ socket using SPI or 2-wire UART interface and can generate random numbers at a rate up to 1 Mbps in SPI mode and up to 1.5 Mbps in UART mode.

This repository contains the MicroRNG Software Kit and utilities for using the MicroRNG device with Raspberry PI 3+ or other Linux-based single-board computers via the SPI interface.
